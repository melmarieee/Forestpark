              The area occupied by the Arroceros Forest Park used to be part of Parián, the Chinese trading settlement during the early Spanish colonial period. In the 19th century, it was the site of the Fabrica de Arroceros, a tobacco factory owned and operated by the Compañía General de Tabacos de Filipinas.
               During the American period, it was used as a military garrison which housed the Signal Corps at the Cuartel de Infantería and the Surgeon General's office at the Estado Mayor.
               When the Philippines gained independence after World War II, the barracks were converted into the headquarters of the Department of Education.[3]
              The park was established in 1993 after the government's education department offices were transferred to its present location in Pasig. Through a memorandum of agreement signed between the City of Manila and Winner Foundation supported by then First Lady Amelita Ramos, the city agreed to lease the site for development as a nature park by the private environmental group. With an initial 150 century-old trees that survived the war, the park now hosts over 3,000 trees through reforestation efforts spearheaded by the Manila Seedling Bank.[3][1]

                  Arroceros Urban Forest Park is often referred to as a "breathing space" in the midst of the urban environment of Manila. It serves as a green oasis where people can escape the hustle and bustle of the city and enjoy a tranquil environment filled with trees, plants, and wildlife.
