            <p>The park was established in 1993 after the government's education department offices were transferred to its present location in Pasig. Through a memorandum of agreement signed between the City of Manila and Winner Foundation supported by then First Lady Amelita Ramos, the city agreed to lease the site for development as a nature park by the private environmental group.</p>
            <p>With an initial 150 century-old trees that survived the war, the park now hosts over 3,000 trees through reforestation efforts spearheaded by the Manila Seedling Bank.</p>
            <p>Arroceros Urban Forest Park is often referred to as a "breathing space" in the midst of the urban environment of Manila. It serves as a green oasis where people can escape the hustle and bustle of the city and enjoy a tranquil environment filled with trees, plants, and wildlife.</p>
